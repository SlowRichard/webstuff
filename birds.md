### Morning commute

 - Heron on log over weir, preening.
 - Dead hedgehog on Kelvin path, past the footbridge. Never seen any hedgehogs in Glasgow before.
 - Young fox on opposite bank, near outlet pipe.
 - Mallard and 5 (quite grown up) young, dabbling on river.

### At work (220 High Street)

 - Possible bird of prey? Largish brown bird flying over trees beyond car park, didn't come close enough to see clearly. Hazel and I both saw one (grey and brown on upper wing) a few weeks ago, couldn't identify.

### Evening commute

 - Goosander and 4 almost fully grown young, basking in sun on gravelly island under Kelvinbridge.
