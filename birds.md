# Wildlife log book

To be replaced with something more practical.

## 2018-07-04

- Fox down by the river Kelvin, then saw two dippers fly in. Possibly they were fighting over territory.
- Goldfinch song in George Square, High Street and Ingram Street.

## 2018-07-05

- 4 goldfinches flying past window at work.

## 2018-07-07

### Port of Menteith

 - Lots of blue damselflies around reeds at edge of lawn at the Lake Hotel (trying out for Izzy's wedding catering.)

## 2018-07-08

### Gartmore

- Swifts and martins flying over the garden, martins in nest above mailbox gazing out waiting to be fed. Must be close to fledging.
- Couple of damselflies down estate near the swan pond, sound of crickets but none seen.

## 2018-07-09

### Morning commute

- Heron on log over weir, preening.
- Dead hedgehog on Kelvin path, past the footbridge. Never seen any hedgehogs in Glasgow before.
- Young fox on opposite bank, near outlet pipe.
- Mallard and 5 (quite grown up) young, dabbling on river.

### At work (220 High Street)

- Possible bird of prey? Largish brown bird flying over trees beyond car park, didn't come close enough to see clearly. Hazel and I both saw one (grey and brown on upper wing) a few weeks ago, couldn't identify.

### Evening commute

- Goosander and 4 almost fully grown young, basking in sun on gravelly island under Kelvinbridge.

## 2018-07-10

### Evening commute

- Mallard and 5 (I think) almost fully grown young dabbling at the rapids just before Kelvinbridge.

## 2018-07-11

### Evening commute

- Goosander and young again, on gravelly island, this time it's overcast.
- AM and PM there was some squealing sounds in the tunnel under Kelvinbridge, nest behind the netting?

## 2018-07-16

- Rainy day, walking in the estate, lots of tiny frogs on the road hopping out of the way
  - Honey had a look but not that interested.
- Looking through binoculars at the Swan Pond saw a fish jumping from the water. Small silvery thing that jumped clear of the water by about its own length.

## 2018-07-20

- Waiting for train connection in Edinburgh, douple of (herring?) gulls at park by Princes St station. Guy next to me dropped a bit of banana, gull looked pretty timid approaching, darted at bananan once close, then ran away.
- Also heard goldfinches, saw a wagtail on the lawn.

## 2018-07-21

- Lots of red kites around Watermead and Marlow, almost guaranteed to see some in the sky.
- Wood pigeons seem huge here.

## 2018-07-22

- Watched a collared dove bringing twigs to the tree in Allan's driveway, looks like it's building a nest?
- A couple of kites seen over the motorway, somewhere between Leeds and York.

## 2018-07-26

- Saw a colouful butterfly, possibly tortoiseshell, flying near the flats in Hotspur Street. Didn't settle so couldn't tell exactly what it was. I'm sure there are a lot more butterflies around this year
  - last year I pretty much only saw orange tips in Glasgow.

## 2018-08-06 to 10

...

## 2018/09/02

- Plenty of Starlings about at the moment, going after Rowan berries.

## 2018-10-29

- Dead bird outside work, thought it might be a jack snipe, but Kristian identified as a woodcock, size and horizontal stripes on back of head instead of vertical. Probably on migration, either ran out of food, hunted or road accident.

## 2018-11-04

- Out walking in the park by the Kelvin, saw three dippers at once. Two were close to either other on near bank, other was directly across on opposite bank.
  - River was quite high - maybe they couldn't find many good spots?
- Later, crossing the bridge on Queen Margaret Drive, heard a noise and looked down - a kingfisher flying along the river, first sighting since last winter I think.
