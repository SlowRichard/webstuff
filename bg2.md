# Baldur's Gate notes

## Rielev

It appears you are not prepared for the consequences of your actions. I offer advice since you may not survive without it. Seek out Rielev. He waits for such as you.

Offer him the release that he craves and you shall find that the focus of your journey shall soon become apparent. Farewell!
